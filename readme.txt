You will be given a PDF document that contains both textual and graphical data. Your task is to:

* Extract the textual and graphical information from the PDF pages.
* Convert the extracted graphical data (such as charts or graphs) into a structured, queryable format.
* Implement a system where users can ask questions and receive meaningful responses based on the extracted data.


Requirements:
* Document your approach and display your results in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb)
* Your solution should allow users to query both the extracted text and any data that was derived from the graphical elements (such as tables).
* Provide brief explanations of your approach, choices made, and any challenges you encountered.
