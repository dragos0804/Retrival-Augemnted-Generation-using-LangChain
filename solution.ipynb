    "# Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given a PDF document that contains both textual and graphical data. Your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extract the textual and graphical information from the PDF pages.\n",
    "* Convert the extracted graphical data (such as charts or graphs) into a structured, queryable format.\n",
    "* Implement a system where users can ask questions and receive meaningful responses based on the extracted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "* Document your approach and display your results in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb)\n",
    "* Your solution should allow users to query both the extracted text and any data that was derived from the graphical elements (such as tables).\n",
    "* Provide brief explanations of your approach, choices made, and any challenges you encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "# Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the presented notebook, you may find two approaches:\n",
    "1. The short method, which uses the pdf as an input and allows for discussion based on the pdf context\n",
    "2. The larger one, which uses a manual extraction of the contents of the pdf in order to feed it to the RAG solution in a similar manner to the first approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches make good use of the RAG system provided via <a href=\"https://python.langchain.com/\">langchain</a> and <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\">Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach makes use of the PdfFileManager class that I have implemented, which aims to extract all text and graphical data manually. Despite the text extraction not being as much of a difficult task, the extraction of the charts and diagrams is a challenge I have not managed to overcome manually. I turned to converting the pages of the given pdf into images, followed by placing them in a pretrained <a href = \"https://huggingface.co/naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-docvqa\">donut</a> or a <a href = \"https://huggingface.co/naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-docvqa\">GPT-Vision-1-ft</a> model in order to achieve the retrieval of the graphical data and, later on, converting that data into a queryable format, but those trails have met no success, therefore, I have not managed to achieve the second point from this task in the expected manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible way to achieve the task might have been to, optionally, have a network that does a segmentation task over the graphs/charts/diagrams. Those graphs (or entire pages containing graphs) could have then been interpreted by another network, like a GPT-4 Vision network, which is able to perform the task of chart description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach cannot make use of a graph interpreter, as it uses the pdf as a whole for the input. In addition, the statistical data on the charts that are given, which, in this case, are text and .svg based, is interpreted better than I have personally expected. (see \"TESTS FOR APPROACH No. 1\" section)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the graphs in the pdf file contain text information, that information will be scraped too when collecting the entire textual data. This leads to some interestingly good results when creating an interpretation from the second approach. So, despite not being able to correctly extract the graphs manually and create queryable data from them, the task seems to be successfully achieved."
